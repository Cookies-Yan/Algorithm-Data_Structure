` Implement the deletion from a binary search tree `

###### 1. Make a BST(THE NODE structure must NOT have parent pointer)
###### 2. The tree must have at least 15 nodes.
###### 3. Make the BST and do a inorder traversal
###### 4. Delete the nodes as follows:
           a. a leaf node.  Then  inorder traversal.
           b. a node that has a subtree.  Then inorder traversal.
